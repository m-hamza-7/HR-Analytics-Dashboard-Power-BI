# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Power-BI
This project focuses on HR analytics using real-world data from AtliQ, an Indian-based company. The dataset consists of daily attendance records for employees over a 3-month period, capturing various attendance scenarios such as Present, Paid Leave, Sick Leave, Work from Home, and more.


## Project Objectives

 ### Calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
<ul>
    <li>Presence Percentage, Sick Leave Percentage (SL%), and Work from Home Percentage (WFH%) for each employee.</li>
</ul>

 ### Visualize Attendance Trends:
<ul>
    <li>Analyze daily and monthly trends in attendance metrics.</li>
</ul>

### Evaluate Leave Utilization:
<ul>
    <li>Assess the usage of different types of leaves (e.g., Sick Leave, Paid Leave, Work from Home).</li>
</ul>

 ### Support Data-Driven Decisions:
<ul>
    <li>Provide actionable insights to HR teams for workforce management and policy optimization.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Generated visualizations to show the distribution of different leave types (e.g., Sick Leave, Paid Leave, Work from Home).</li>
  <li>Highlighted the most frequently used leave types and their impact on productivity.</li>
</ul>

### Employee-Level Insights:
<ul>
  <li>Analyzed individual employee attendance records to identify patterns in absenteeism and remote work.</li>
